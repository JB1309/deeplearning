# deeplearning
This repository contains code for training a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model for transliteration using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically LSTM cells, implemented in PyTorch. The model is designed for transliteration tasks, where a sequence in one language is converted into a corresponding sequence in another language.

Requirements
To run the code, you need the following libraries:

Pandas for data processing

Install the required libraries using pip:

pip install torch pandas
File Structure
train_model.py: Main training script that trains the Seq2Seq model.

hi.translit.sampled.train.tsv: The training dataset (replace with your own data if needed).

hi.translit.sampled.dev.tsv: The development dataset (replace with your own data if needed).

README.md: This file.

Dataset
The dataset consists of two columns:

src: Source language text (e.g., Hindi transliteration).

tgt: Target language text (e.g., Romanized form).

The dataset should be in TSV (tab-separated values) format, where each row corresponds to a pair of source and target language text.

Example:

css

src	tgt
अ	a
आप	āp
Model Architecture
1. Encoder
The encoder uses an embedding layer followed by an RNN layer (LSTM). The input sequence is embedded and passed through the RNN to obtain hidden states.

2. Decoder
The decoder is also an RNN (LSTM). It takes the output from the encoder (hidden states) and generates the target sequence. The decoder uses teacher forcing during training, which means it uses the actual previous target token as input for the next time step with a certain probability (controlled by TEACHER_FORCING_RATIO).

3. Seq2Seq Model
The Seq2Seq model connects the encoder and decoder, and handles the generation of the target sequence based on the source sequence.

Hyperparameters
EMBED_DIM: Dimension of the embedding vectors.

HIDDEN_DIM: Number of units in the hidden layer of the LSTM.

NUM_LAYERS: Number of LSTM layers.

RNN_TYPE: Type of RNN to use (LSTM or GRU).

BATCH_SIZE: Batch size for training.

EPOCHS: Number of training epochs.

TEACHER_FORCING_RATIO: Probability of using teacher forcing during training.

Training the Model
Dataset Format
Make sure you have the training (hi.translit.sampled.train.tsv) and validation (hi.translit.sampled.dev.tsv) files in the correct format. If you have your own dataset, update the train_file and dev_file paths in the code.

Steps to Train:
Place your training (train.tsv) and validation (dev.tsv) dataset files in the correct paths.

Run the training script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train_model.py
Training Process:
Data Loading: The dataset is loaded using PyTorch's DataLoader. The dataset is tokenized and padded to handle variable-length sequences.

Model Training: The model is trained for the specified number of epochs using the Adam optimizer. During each epoch, the loss is calculated using the cross-entropy loss function.

Evaluation: After each epoch, the model is evaluated on the validation set. The accuracy is calculated based on the number of correctly predicted transliterations.

Teacher Forcing: During training, teacher forcing is applied with the specified ratio (TEACHER_FORCING_RATIO).

Evaluation
The evaluation step runs after each epoch and calculates the accuracy by comparing the predicted transliterations with the ground truth. Additionally, the first five examples (source, prediction, target) are printed for inspection.

Sample Output
During training, the script will print the following information:


Epoch 1/10
Training Loss: 1.2345
Validation Accuracy: 0.8534
Source: आप | Prediction: aap | Target: aap
Source: नमस्ते | Prediction: namaste | Target: namaste
Source: धन्यवाद | Prediction: dhanyavaad | Target: dhanyavaad
...
Model Inference
After training, the model can be used for inference by passing a source text sequence through the encoder and decoder.

# Example inference:
encoder.eval()
decoder.eval()

input_text = "आप"
input_tensor = torch.tensor([train_dataset.encode(input_text, train_dataset.src_vocab)]).to(device)
hidden = encoder(input_tensor)
output, _ = decoder(input_tensor, hidden)
output_text = train_dataset.decode(output.argmax(-1).cpu().tolist(), train_dataset.tgt_vocab)
print(f"Transliteration: {output_text}")
Notes
Teacher Forcing: The TEACHER_FORCING_RATIO controls how much teacher forcing is applied during training. Setting it to 1 means always using the actual target for the next time step, and setting it to 0 means using the model's previous prediction.

Padding: The sequences are padded using the <pad> token to handle variable-length input and output sequences.



GPT-2 Model for Lyrics Generation
This repository contains code to fine-tune the GPT-2 language model on a lyrics dataset for text generation. The fine-tuned model can be used to generate new song lyrics based on the training data.

Requirements
To run the code, you need the following libraries:


Hugging Face's transformers library

You can install the required libraries using pip:


pip install torch transformers
File Structure
train_model.py: Main script that loads the GPT-2 model, prepares the dataset, and trains the model.

lyrics.txt: The dataset file containing the lyrics (replace this with your own dataset).


Dataset
The dataset (lyrics.txt) should contain song lyrics. Each line in the file corresponds to a single lyric or a part of a song.

Example format:

mathematica

I was walking down the street
When I saw you, I couldn't breathe
Ensure that the text is formatted in a way suitable for language modeling. Each song or lyric should be separated by newlines for better training performance.

Model Architecture
The GPT-2 model used for this task is a transformer-based architecture that is pre-trained on large corpora of text data. The model is then fine-tuned on a custom dataset (in this case, song lyrics).

Fine-Tuning the Model
Steps to Fine-Tune:
Prepare Dataset: Ensure that you have the lyrics dataset (lyrics.txt) in the correct directory. The file should contain song lyrics, one line per lyric or song part.

Run the Training Script: Run the train_model.py script to fine-tune the GPT-2 model on the provided dataset:


python train_model.py
Training Process:
Dataset Loading: The dataset is loaded using Hugging Face's TextDataset, which tokenizes the lyrics text.

Model Fine-Tuning: The GPT-2 model is fine-tuned using the provided lyrics dataset. The model learns to predict the next word in a sequence of lyrics.

Training Arguments: The training is set for 3 epochs with a batch size of 2. Training checkpoints are saved every 500 steps.

Training Hyperparameters:
num_train_epochs: 3 epochs

per_device_train_batch_size: 2

save_steps: Save model checkpoints every 500 steps

save_total_limit: Only keep the last 2 model checkpoints

logging_steps: Log training progress every 100 steps

block_size: 128 tokens per input sequence

Model Inference
After training, the model can be used to generate lyrics based on a prompt. You can load the fine-tuned model and tokenizer like this:


from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("./gpt2-lyrics-model")
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("./gpt2-lyrics-model")

input_text = "I am walking down the street"
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

output = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=200, num_return_sequences=1)

generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(generated_text)
This will generate a sequence of text (song lyrics) starting from the input prompt.

Save and Load the Model
After training, the fine-tuned model and tokenizer are saved in the ./gpt2-lyrics-model directory. You can later load them for inference or further fine-tuning.


model.save_pretrained("./gpt2-lyrics-model")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("./gpt2-lyrics-model")
To load the model and tokenizer for inference:


model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("./gpt2-lyrics-model")
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("./gpt2-lyrics-model")
Notes
Training Time: Fine-tuning a model like GPT-2 can take a significant amount of time depending on the dataset size and the available hardware. Running this code on a machine with a GPU is recommended for faster training.

Lyrics Dataset: The model performance depends on the quality and diversity of the dataset. The more varied and extensive the lyrics dataset, the more creative and diverse the generated lyrics will be.
